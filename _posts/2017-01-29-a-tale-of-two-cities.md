A Tale Of Two Cities

Where do I begin? Where do I end? What do I keep, and what do I throw away? What do I claim, and what do I condone?

A tale of two cities. A savage metropolis, a serene town. A city I would rather forget the existence of, a city thatâ€™s etched bloodily in my memory. The lanes of love, the streets of screams. The alleys of flowers, the sidewalks of blood.  The city where lukewarm nails left blisters, the city where frigid palms felt as soft as snowflakes. 

What have I left behind? 

A city inundated by life, or a city flooded with death? The city of mountains that still echo my screams, or the coast side city where I drowned my sorrow? The city drenched in rain, or the city drier than my parched throat? A city which still remembers me as a Robber, or a city which adores me like a Sunset? 

Two Cities. Which one beckons me, which one repulses me? 
Two Cities. Which one to fly to? Which one to crash into?

Did I even begin? Do I now, end?
