You can't be the ocean as that's far and vast  
You can't be the sea as that's a slip of it all  
You can't be a lake as that's confined for space  
You can't be the rain it wets you through  
Cause a moment it's here and a moment there too  
You can't be something so little cause you are meant big  
You can't be vast cause now that's just mean  
How can you offer so much  
With so much to give that you might end up with nothing to hold in  
But you feel like a river  
That travels along  
Starts at the hill tops  
Might mix with the salt  
How fresh you are  
How sweet you taste  
The sights you see  
The lands you bless  
Life you hold, the life you give  
The world's too weak to exist without you in it  
The paths you make, the humans you change  
Oh what a strange beau you are  
Cause these words never seem to end  
You choose your life and the route you take  
You might start up north and then head west  
Directions are but just your will  
We humans just are to exist cause you give  
Through these forests and the swamps  
Oh what world you create for us all  
A sight we lay and that's done for all  
You cause the art cause you are  
Thoughts that spin and the words are woven  
The strokes of paint, the murals of clay  
But what you are we can never compare  
Time passes by as the humans do  
You feel like you would exist then too.
