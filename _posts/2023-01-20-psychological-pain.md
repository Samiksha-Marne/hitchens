Just a play of tricks is what all is  
Make believe in stuff around  
Fictions and non fictions messing up n down  
The thoughts that seem to be jumbled up  
What to believe and what not to  
Is the forever question ongoing  
The trust is a whole different scene   
To trust someone are you kidding?  
Can't be trusting your own brain and mind  
A whole different human what's that thing ?  
Thoughts so deep that the leaving scars  
Scars as such that you can't even see  
Oh here's the wound see it bleed  
Oh I'm sorry what do you mean  
It's all in brain all in my thoughts  
I can feel the pain i can feel bleed  
Just cause you don't see the thing  
Don't mean that it don't exist  
Don't be cruel don't jest around  
These are my feelings you laughing about  
But then again you aren't the only one  
The voices in the head scream louder than you lot  
Oh you sorry you hurt me  
What's that thing  
You already did it early just in my brains  
Been numb with all the thoughts  
Cause all bad actions have been hurt long gone  
Saving everyone around that's the plan  
But why does it not seem to go well long  
And if it does why didn't it be better  
What's with the praises ?  
I could have been better  
Don't you know that i have intent in all  
It's all about me never about you  
When behind the facade it's all for you  
But don't give those words  
That's not true that's not worth it   
Just some stupid shit i do  
No thought given just messing around  
Been fooling myself saying that shit around  
Oh why do you not see it's all me  
I never will amount to anything  
That's all the brain seems to scream  
I can do better give in some more  
I will empty myself out bleed through sheets   
Aren't i worth it ? Please tell me
