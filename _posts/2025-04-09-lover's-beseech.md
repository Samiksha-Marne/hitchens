Oh you sweet child of Mary  
Oh how much you been through  
It's enough now you ought to rest  
Let the clock reset it through  
The smile of yours let them shine bright  
Not because you have too  
But because they feel right  
And this moment is enough now  
No I could never be in your head  
Those demons are yours to fight  
But when the sunsets  
Run back to my arms and let me hold you a while  
Let worries just slip past  
Let me help you believe you are enough  
Let those guard walls down  
Let these little flowers of hope bloom  
Let them bring in the song birds  
Singing the sweetest melodies of your worth  
The green grass and the suns warmth  
The river that gently flows along  
Come rest with me in this meadow  
Let the stars reset the life that's lived  
And paint pretty pictures of life you earned  
And make it as the one you want  
Just hold my hand and walk along  
And everything will be fine  
You aren't born in this world to be alone  
But to be surrounded by life  
The laughs , the giggles, the shy smiles  
Let it all bring in the warmth  
You ought to exist  
And that's a must  
Not because you have too  
But there's too much left  
So much to see and taste and live  
So much to hear and feel and breathe  
So come along you sweet child of Mary  
Let me along with you  
I can't fight those demons for you  
But let stay while you do  
So we can smile  
The warmest ones  
And live a life  
A pretty one at that.
