The path that's rarely taken that's what I am  
Covered in the flora and fauna at best  
Come take a walk  
Feel the grass at your feet  
Look around in wonder the flies that breathe  
Come enjoy me a bit  
Stroll along these walks  
Admire the colour spread  
Mostly green tho I must say  
But the pops are worth the time I shall say  
The breeze I carry is sweet and chill  
Give me a try I won't disappoint you a bit  
Come sit on these rocks by the river bed  
Let your hair down and breathe this instance  
Soothe your eyes on what I offer  
Just you and me for a while  
Please stay i beg  
Don't just walk by and look the other way  
That's why I remain as  
The path that's rarely taken
