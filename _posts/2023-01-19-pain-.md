Pain what a sweet thing you ought  
Leaving a mark every moment you on  
Drying up tears seems like drought  
But the heart weeps like the heavens lost  
What a pretty thing you are  
Bleed everytime you come everytime you gone  
Oh such cruel being you are  
Oh i pray you tell me why  
Do you prey on this human why  
Is it the chase or the denial  
Causing you to play the part  
When you're gonna aches the parts   
That kinds of memory just holds on  
Addicting like the sugar that you seem  
Stinging like the spice in my wound you are  
Marked all pretty by the scars  
Yet no tear to be seen from afar  
What's the mystery what's the plan  
Why must one bare the pain  
Like a joke played on fool along  
The painted smiles seems to last  
Water seems never enough  
To wipe the stains left to burden  
So here you go on new day on  
Putting the painted smiles back on  
Staining the skins for more time on  
Questions burden the minds and hearts  
Who is to win answer that is  
Pain o pain you pretty little thing  
Pray tell me what's your story  
Show the scars and facades  
Cast over the little soul you are  
Show me the highs where you fell  
Show me the lows you swam through  
Show me the ways you just drifted along  
Just to exist as you are you
