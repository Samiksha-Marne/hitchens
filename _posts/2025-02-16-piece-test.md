Oh what a life it was for ye  
To be treasured and valued  
To be treated with care  
To be rode with honor  
Oh what a life it was for ye  
You fought wars and rode them to victory  
You carried lives from here to eternity  
You stood for what you are and what's meant to be  
Oh what a life it was for ye  
Treated as an equal  
Treated fair and square  
Treated with love and care  
Oh what a life it was for ye  
Look where this cycle has got you now  
Look how you are a mere tool of amusement  
Look what these humans bring alone  
Oh what a life it is for ye  
The pain and trauma when you give it your all  
Who's to blame this state of life  
What's even at the end of this line  
Oh what a life it is for ye  
Struggling and struggling till end meets thee  
Two steps ahead and four steps back to three  
Just you exist for me and that's it.  
Oh what a life it was for ye  
Oh what a life it is for ye  
Oh what a life it will be for ye  
-Seed
