Oh to be the droplets that touch thy skin  
That rolls down in just a whim  
To be the one that soothes thyself  
Taking away the wrath of the day  
Oh to be the one who refreshes you  
I wish I could just kiss you  
Take all your worries away and leave you behind in ease and bliss  
Oh to be the droplets chosen to be the one
