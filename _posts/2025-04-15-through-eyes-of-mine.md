Oh how do I tell you 
How beautiful you are to me 
You existing in that shirt of yours
Sleeve bunched up 
The tattoos that peak through 
The curly hair lying messed on your 
Those playful eyes that got so much to tell
That big fucking smile that just feels the best 
Those cheeks so soft and the hue they get at times
Those Little ears peaking from your hair
Little nose that wrinkles and carries those glasses
Which sheild those mysteries in your eyes
The skin you have is so soft 
Oh pray tell me 
How do I explain how beautiful you are 
Those hands of yours are just so exquisite 
And those little fingers covered in rings
And when in my hands just feel so good 
It feels so nice and fits so perfect
Oh when you speak it's so nice 
Worries what's that ?
They seem blur out
You over the screen feels so nice 
Sometimes wish I could reach out 
And drag you to mine
Hold you , cherish you
Make essence mine
How I wish I could have you in mine
Let you see yourself through my eyes
I think of a thousand words 
And speak quite a sum
Oh but how I wish you my sweet angel 
I could explain 
How beautiful you are to mine 
I close my eyes and see your smile
I watch some to pass my time
But stuff I watch reminds me of you 
And here I am again
Preaching of your beauty divine 
Oh tell sweet lord
How do I string these words
How do I get them to say 
How do I tell my sweet love
How beautifully divine she is in my eyes.
