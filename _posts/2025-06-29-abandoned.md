Abandoned as we all are  
Born alone to exist  
Exist alone to survive  
The way of life like a satire  
To laugh at the moment  
Where you ought to cry  
Is this a beauty  
So beautiful and divine  
Built to hold on families for life  
But now here it stands  
Alone and fragile  
The windows once meant to dream  
Are hollow from inside  
The walls that could be so warm to reside  
But now just tainted with vile words  
To house the humans was once built  
But now the nature takes its course  
The saplings that dig deep in me  
Aren't I beautiful to see ?  
I could have been so much more  
But now I am content  
Cause what lives in me is far greater than them  
Here I am abandoned none the less  
But abandoned in aesthetic that's for sure now I say  
It's upto to the watcher , to the protagonist I say  
To admire my beauty through their rightful gaze  
And then for them to walk on in their life to exist  
But until my time goes on  
I shall exist .
