Well this is what it feels like  
Breathing in air and still feel like drowning  
Yes this is what it feels like  
Having everything around and still not enough  
Everything is good  
Everything is fine  
All is all good and dandy  
So doesn't it feel right  
Why does my chest ache  
Why can't it just fade  
Why does it feel like I am drowning all over again  
I don't know how to swim  
Maybe that's the reason to begin  
Why does everything just feel so cold  
I don't know if I just wanna wrap me up  
To stay warm and good  
Or just so I can pretend I don't exist no more  
Every breath I take feels like a sin  
Like I am stealing from someone who deserves it instead  
Could be so much more  
But I am not doing anything  
Every morsel I take  
Every inch I move  
Every human that I talk to  
Don't feel like  
But why do I have to warn and let people know  
Why can't I just fade in nothingness below  
Why are words so hard  
Why is existing such a task  
Just to fade into a background is all I ask  
The love I get why do I have to send it back  
The care I get, the words I receive  
Why do they need to be answered  
When can I just lay and be one with the bed  
But then again am I not just stealing the bed  
The clothes I wear  
The voice I speak  
The person I am  
Is all but stolen bits  
I am all but a burden in this life  
These words I write  
Why should I bother to utter  
All these thoughts I have why dare I express  
Happiness I get  
The food I eat  
Isn't this all just a stolen sin  
What do I do  
Just to not feel this ache  
Maybe I should just drown while breathing instead  
Every morsel I swallow just pushes it all back  
It hurts to ingest  
Cause it means I stay alive  
But I got to eat otherwise I hear those words  
And I would rather just stuff and be a burden  
Sorry is all I have to offer  
Cause else do I say  
I can't blabber all this out  
Cause then what next  
The humans I have that I keep dragging down  
Do I just cut them out  
Cause that would be better for them in the end  
But then again I am selfish in the end  
I need them to be happy  
Cause I leech off them  
I am sorry I am sorry  
That's all I can say  
Please forgive me  
And maybe forget me instead
