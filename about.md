Well, hello there, my radiant little wanderer—aren’t you just the brightest beam of light to stumble into my corner? I’m Samiksha Marne, and I’ve been waiting for you. Don’t worry, not in the “chains in the basement” way… probably.

I’m a part-time overthinker, full-time collector of strange little moments. I like to wrap them in ribbons of sunshine, then slip in just enough shadow to make you wonder if it’s safe to unwrap.

My work lives in that lovely in-between: tender but a little twisted, warm but with teeth. You might smile, you might flinch, you might do both at once (which is exactly how I like it).

So, welcome. Think of this as a gallery made of sunlight and whispers—sweet on the tongue, but with something sharp just beneath the sugar.
